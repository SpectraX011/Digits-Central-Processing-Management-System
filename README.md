Project Description: DCPMS

Digital Clearance and Participation Management System (DCPMS) is a student management tool I originally developed in 2025 as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) finals project.
The system is designed to streamline how schools and organizations handle student clearance and participation in events.

Key Features

- Attendance Tracking
Records student attendance during official events and activities.

- Clearance Monitoring
Ensures that students meet clearance requirements by participating in mandatory events.

- Sanction System
Students who fail to attend required events automatically receive sanctions.

- Digital Officer Notifications
Officers are notified to inform students of penalties. For example, non-attendance results in a ₱50 fine that students must settle.

Purpose
DCPMS was built to reduce manual paperwork, improve accountability, and provide a fair, automated way of enforcing participation rules. It reflects the principles of OOP in Python, applying modular design and real-world logic to student management.

 Tech Stack
- Vanilla PHP (pure PHP) for backend logic
- CSS for styling and user interface design
- MySQL Database for storing student records, attendance logs, and sanctions
  
 Development Notes
This project was created as a group submission, but I was the one who developed the entire system (coding, database integration, and functionality). My teammates contributed by preparing the documentation and reports.
